            ## JobSpy Mobile
            - Flutter client for the JobSpy API: quick health checks plus LinkedIn/Indeed search in one place.
            - GetX-powered navigation/state, validated inputs, and clear error/no-results messaging.
            - Production build is obfuscated and release-signed; split debug symbols kept out of the artifact.

            ## Highlights
            - CI gates on analyze + tests before tagging and releasing (robots approved this drop).
            - Auto SemVer bump, tagged release, and packaged artifact from main.
            - Debug-only network logging so production stays quiet.

            ## Test drive
            - Hit your API endpoint and watch the health card flip to green.
            - Run LinkedIn/Indeed queries with location and recent-hours filters.
            - Open listings in the native app or browser; verify badges/metadata look sane.

            ## Known beta quirks
            - Still in beta—if you spot gremlins, file an issue with steps/logs. We fix fast and caffeinated.
